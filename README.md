# Covid Stats

The goal of this project was to get familiar with the basics of GraphQL and Apollo Server by creating a GraphQL layer on top of an existing API endpoint. Using the [Coronavirus Smartable API](https://rapidapi.com/SmartableAI/api/coronavirus-smartable/) and Apollo Server, I built a simple GraphQL server that I can query as a client to get Covid-19 stats about each U.S. state.
